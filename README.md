# 🧲 Magnetic Cursor Hover Effect

This project demonstrates a sleek **magnetic cursor effect**, where elements slightly "follow" your mouse when hovered — just like a magnetic pull. It uses **vanilla JavaScript** and **CSS transitions**, no external libraries needed.

Ideal for creating interactive buttons, cards, or playful UI components on modern websites.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Detects the position of the mouse over an element
2. Calculates the distance between the cursor and the element’s center
3. Applies a small CSS `translate()` transform in that direction
4. On `mouseleave`, the element smoothly returns to its original position
